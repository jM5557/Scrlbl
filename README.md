# Scrlbl
A customized visual way of navigating through an array of objects.

Simple tool for scrolling through an array horizontally using buttons. Built with Javascript and JQuery.

#How To Use It
Simply add the two files: scroll.js and scroll_style.css to your project and link them to your html file.

#Customize It
Open up scroll.js and edit the array `objectArr` with the array contents that you desire. 
By default the tool is built onto your document body. Change the variable `parent` to the parent element that you want for the tool.
